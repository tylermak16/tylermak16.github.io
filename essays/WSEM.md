## Why Software Engineering Matters

Software engineering is a blanket term used to describe the process or approach of solving a problem through analysis, program design,  implementation of the solution into code, testing the functionality the program, deploying the program, and lastly ensuring it is maintanable, or able to be understood by others in case they might need adapt it to better suit their own purposes in the future. Although one might think of software engineering as something only done by companies like Meta or Airbnb, it used by virtually everyone who wants to create an application or solve a problem through code. 

When it comes to my career and what I want to do in life, I aspire to be a machine learning engineer and work with A.I in general. This was because I was amazed by the wide ranging applications of machine learning to create functionality in programs that wouldn't be practical otherwise and how it can be used to effectively parse through data to generate new insights. I discovered that I wanted to pursue data science and machine learning because similar to machine learning models, the more I learned about different topics and academic disciplines the more patterns and connections I found between them. Learning how everything is interconnected and how they influence each other allowed me to better appreciate the world I live in and evoked my passion for learning. 

//How knowing software engineering is then important for me to create machine learning applications, (maybe how similar it is to the apporahces of data scientists), and how if i want to solve problems using programming and a.i i would havfe to learn the process of software enginerring and its skills such as problem analysis, solution design, etc.
