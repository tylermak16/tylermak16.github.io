## My thoughts on Javascript

From what I've learned about Javascript, it is one of the more higher level languages that I know, other than python. Considering that many features seem to be automated, like the type of variables, it seems that its definitely for more casual users who don't have to create programs where every bit of efficiency matters rather than large groups of people in a company. However, recently, I had the opportunity to talk with some professionals in IT and cybersecurity who explained to me the importance of code being user friendly so that it could be maintained long term when inevitably new pairs of eyes have to work with the code. In regards to ES6 syntax, i'm not so sure about how I feel about how useful it is. I think the sheer amount of it made it hard to remember the exact syntaxes and solving the potential errors from writing the wrong syntax would take more time than it could potentially save when writing programs in a really short time frame.

## Like an athlete, practice!

The method used in my ICS class to teach us about software engineering and working with others to solve a problem, to me, is really useful for preparing us for how an actual job in programming would be like. I think the athletic approach to teaching, where you keep doing regular practice and reinforcement of coding, to improve is very important because you learn the most when you are engaged and actually working with something than just passively learning about it. This learning style could be seen as slightly stressful, due to the WODS being all or nothing and the time limits, however from my experience, a little bit of stress is important to push you to achieve your goals and tasks.
