After experiencing a bit of html, css and the bootstrap framework, I can say confidently that bootstrap does not make web design easier. In fact, I had a much harder time working with it and could not get the hang of it. However, that does not mean that bootstrap is pointless, as it allowed me to utilize new features and be more specific on my design choices in a way that just wasn't possible or sensible in html,css. If you are able to get over the learning curve with UI frameworks, you could easily design more complex websites and save a lot of time. 

I think I struggled with bootstrap partly because I couldn't sink a lot of time into it, but the guides to it were not as precise as they could be and relied on you experimenting a lot for yourself. Moreover, I had trouble finding how to precisely adjust elements through html and css. 
An example of a website I made in an assignment with heavy assistance: 

<img class = "img-fluid" src = "img/Screenshot 2024-02-22 222655.png">
