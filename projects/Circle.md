summary: "A program that creates a Circle and Cylinder subclass to streamline mathematical calculations involving these shapes. Operations include calculating surface area and volume."
---

In this program, circle objects are constructed from an argument that represents the area of a circle. Cylinder is a subclass of circle and is initalized from a radius and height variable. Circle objects can perform area calculations, while cylinders can perform surface area, area, and volume calculations based on its own properties.
