summary: "A program that creates a Circle and Cylinder subclass to streamline mathematical calculations involving these shapes. Operations include calculating surface area and volume."
---

In this program, circle objects are constructed from an argument that represents the area of a circle. Cylinder is a subclass of circle and is initalized from a radius and height variable. Circle objects can perform area calculations, while cylinders can perform surface area, area, and volume calculations based on its own properties. The role of this program in my learning was to get used to creating utility classes for larger projects and to introduce us to creating sub classes in C++ by overloading the constructor.
