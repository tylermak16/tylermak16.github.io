summary: "An interface that allows the user to create their own statistical experiments/sample spaces, variables, and events to perform probabilistic calculations and operations."

Here is some code showing some basic operations/calculations that you can use in an experiment: 
```
private static int Factorial(int number) {
        int total = 1;
        while (number > 1) {
            total = total * number;
            number -= 1;
        }
        return total;
    }

    public static int Permutations(int set, int setGroup) {
        if (setGroup > set) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            return Factorial(set) / Factorial(set - setGroup);
        }
    }

    public static int Combinations(int set, int setGroup) {
        if (setGroup > set) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            return Factorial(set) / (Factorial(setGroup) * Factorial(set - setGroup));
        }
    }
```
